#Integer exponents
def: for any \(a \in \mathbb{R}\) :

\[
  a \times a \dots a = a^n
\]

We use the shorthand notation \(a^n\) to denote a product of n equal factors where a is called the base and n is called the exponent.
This is valid for any \(n\) such that \(n \in \mathbb{Z}\)

There are two special cases to look more closely:

\[
  a^0 = 1
\]

for all \(a\) where \(a \in \mathbb{Z}\) and \(a \ne 0\).

\[
  0^0 = undefined
\]

##### this needs explanation

##Even powers and negative numbers
Compare the following two examples:

\[
  (-2)^4 = (-2) \times (-2) \times (-2) \times (-2) = 16
\]

with

\[
  -2^4 = -(2^4) = -16
\]

When the minus sign is upfront the expression it supposes to wrap the whole of it. So the placement of minus sign and the grouping matters.


##Operations with exponents
\[
  3^2 \times 3^5 = (3 \times 3) \times (3 \times 3 \times 3 \times 3 \times 3) = 3^7
\]

So as a general rule when can say that if we multiply two numbers with equal bases we can add the exponents.

\[
  a^m \times a^n = a^{m + n}
\]

##Negative integer exponents
We have look so far which is the meaning of the positive integer exponents and 0, but what about the meaning of a negative integer exponent?, what could mean an expression like:
\[
 a^{-1}
\]

take a look at this expression

\[
  5^{10} \times 5^x = 1
\]

if we follow the rule of how to multiply two numbers with equal bases with exponents
we can say that

\[
  5^{10 + x} = 1
\]

or rewritting \(1\) as \(5^0\)

\[
  5^{10 + x} = 5^0
\]

Now we can take just the exponent part of the equation and solve for x

\[
  10 + x = 0
\]

\[
  x = -10
\]

This is an interesting result because we know that multiply any number by its reciprocal gives us 1
\[
  5^{10} \times \frac{1}{5^{10}} = 1
\]

So we can say that:

\[
  \frac{1}{5^{10}} = 5^{-10}
\]
